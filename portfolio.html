    <h1>This picture here is a representation of the irony for the phrase, "Land of Opportunity." </h1>
    <h1>The picture depicts how it looks like the rich/employers are helping those such as immigrants but all the money is flowing right back into the hat.</h1>
    <h1>The irony is that we claimed that America was the so called, "Land of Opportunity.", yet the employers were not giving workers the best care, pay, or safety measures. </h1>
   <h1> There was never a chance for immigrants to come to America and live out the American dream. It was shown through those living in tenements, in excrement filled streets, and those living paycheck to paycheck.</h1>
   <h1>	Immigrants came here expecting a chance. Instead they were bombarded with low wages, and high rent costs for basic jobs where they could die because there was no safety precautions.</h1>
   <h1> America was never the land of opportunity. This was an opportunity for the rich to get richer, and for the poor to stay under their thumb.</h1>
